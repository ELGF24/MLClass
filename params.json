Emphasis will be on geological, planetary and astronomical applications. Course will cover basic and state of the art techniques, as well as validation techniques for each algorithm.\r\n\r\n#Objective\r\n\r\nStudents will be able to implement and validate different Machine Learning techniques in datasets related to Planetary Sciences, Earth Sciences and Astronomy. Students will learn the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.\r\n\r\n#Course Structure\r\n##Lecture Times\r\nTwo lectures will be held per week on Mondays and Wednesdays from 10:00 AM to 10:50 AM. Both lectures will be in room 312 in the Kuiper Space Sciences Building.\r\n##Course Website\r\nLectures, homework assignments and general information on the course will be available online in the following website: https://leonpalafox.github.io/MLClass/\r\n##Office Hours\r\nI will be available for questions and discussions after lectures. I will have office hours from 13:00 – 14:00 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Otherwise, the students can make an appointment.\r\n\r\n#Evaluation\r\nThe evaluation will consist of:\r\n- Final Project will be 60% of the Final Evaluation.\r\n    - The final project will consist in the correct use and validation of one Machine Learning technique in a dataset related to the student field of study.\r\n\t- The students can form teams of up to three persons.\r\n\t- Graduate students and teams need to write an 8-page report on the data, methodology and conclusions. In addition, make a 10-minute presentation of their work.\r\n\t- Undergraduate students and teams need to write a 5-page report on the data, methodology and conclusions. They can write an 8-page report for extra credit. Students have to make a 5-minute presentation of their work. Students can do a 10-minute presentation for extra credit.\r\n\t- Teams consisting of Graduate and Undergraduate students need to write an 8-page report and prepare a 10-minute presentation. Undergraduate students in the team will be given extra credit.\r\n- In class participation will be 40% of the Final Evaluation\r\n\t- In class participation will consist on programming assignments, assigned readings reports and two quizzes. \r\n\t\t- Graduate students quizzes will consists of five questions and Undergraduate students’ quizzes will consist of four questions. Undergraduate students can answer the five questions for extra credit.\r\n\t- Assignments for Graduate students will have extra requirements. Undergraduate students can meet these requirements for extra credit.\r\n\r\nThere will be an additional 10% extra credit opportunity by submitting additional reports, extracurricular projects and extra participation during the classes.\r\n\r\nHomework assignments submitted after the established due date will be accepted. Assignments submitted after the due date will have a penalty of 20%.\r\n\r\n#Grading\r\nFinal project: 60%\r\n\r\nIn-class participation: 40%\r\n\r\nGrades are assigned as follows:\r\n\r\n-\tA≥90%\r\n-\tB≥75% and <90%\r\n-\tC≥60% and <75%\r\n-\tD≥50% and <60%\r\n-\tF<50%\r\n\r\n#Absence Policies\r\nAttendance to normal sessions is not mandatory.\r\n\r\nIn case of extraordinary circumstances and the students miss either of the quizzes; there will be opportunity for an additional quiz. The instructor will set the date of the make-up quiz. There will be only a single date for additional quizzes.\r\n\r\nCircumstances that merit an additional quiz are:\r\n- Observance of religious holidays\r\n- Sickness \r\n- Absences preapproved by the UA Dean of Students (or Dean’s designee)\r\n- Field Trips / Conferences / Meetings\r\n\r\n#Number of required examinations and papers\r\n\r\nFor Graduate students, there will be two quizzes, four assignments and one final project.\r\n\r\nFor Undergraduate students, there will be two quizzes, four assignments and one final project.\r\n\r\n# Schedule\r\n\r\n1.\t[Introduction] (http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/leonpalafox/MLClass/blob/master/Chapter1Introduction/Introduction.ipynb?flush_cache=true) (Week 1)\r\n  1.
